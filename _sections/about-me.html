<p>Hi! My name is Gregory. I'm a fourth year computer science student at UC Berkeley.
I made this website as a collection of interesting projects I wanted to share and to hopefully
provide a unified public representation of who I am. I'm super interested in computer graphics,
and especially its application to entertainment like animated movies or graphics for video games.
I've always considered computer graphics to be the pinnacle, where artistic creativity, and technological
ingenuity have harmoniously collided. Outside of work I really enjoy movies both animated and not, really well written
speeches (I memorized the entirety of Anton Ego's final monologue in Pixar's
Ratatouille just because it was such a striking scene to me), video games, cooking, looking at really ~aesthetic~ PC builds,
and drinking really cold, crisp water.
Please feel free to look around! I hope you find something that piques your interest.
</p>
